## **ITS COMPOSABLE**

- this `react.js` project provides view about popular feature of react i.e., `composability`

- Thus, it allows to breakdown the application to be built into simple and manageable pieces.

- Which can be then put together to create various other `pages` or also `components`.

- Example is `Header` Component which is ideal for any application in web world, where it's same across every page visited by the user.

- Here creating such custom component would help in:
- Reducing code (no need to write same thing multiple times)
- Reusable code (can be called inside any component)
- Extensible code (allowing to add/ update existing code easily)
- Updatable code (one change reflects everywhere)

## **INSIDE THE BOX**

In this project one would understand how `Navbar` is created as custom component.
